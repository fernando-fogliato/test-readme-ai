### Added
- Re-introduced comprehensive customer management functionality, including API endpoints for CRUD operations (`/customers`). This change restores the `CustomerController`, `Customer` entity, `CustomerRepository`, and `CustomerService` components, making customer data management available again. Initial customer data is also added via `data.sql`.
