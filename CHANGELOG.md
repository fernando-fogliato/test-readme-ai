## [YYYY-MM-DD] - PR #15
### Added
-   **gRPC Support for Department Operations**: Introduced comprehensive gRPC capabilities, including a new gRPC service (`DepartmentGrpcService`) for `Department` entities. This enables high-performance, language-agnostic communication for `Department` CRUD operations via a defined Protocol Buffer contract (`department.proto`).
-   **gRPC Client**: Added `DepartmentGrpcClient` for interacting with gRPC services.
-   **Configuration**: Included necessary build system dependencies (`build.gradle`) and application property configurations (`application.properties`) to enable gRPC server and client functionality.
