### Removed
- **Customer Management Functionality**: The entire suite of customer-related features has been removed. This includes the REST API endpoints (`CustomerController`), the `Customer` entity, its corresponding repository (`CustomerRepository`), and the business logic service (`CustomerService`). This change effectively reverts the previous addition of customer management capabilities.
