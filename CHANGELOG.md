## [YYYY-MM-DD] - PR #15
### Added
-   **gRPC Support for Department Services**: Introduced comprehensive gRPC capabilities for Department-related operations. This includes:
    *   A new gRPC API definition for Department services in `src/main/proto/department.proto`.
    *   A gRPC service implementation (`DepartmentGrpcService`) to expose Department functionalities over gRPC.
    *   A gRPC client (`DepartmentGrpcClient`) for interacting with the new gRPC service.
    *   Necessary build configurations and application properties to enable and configure gRPC.
    This enhancement provides a high-performance, language-agnostic communication layer for Department data.
